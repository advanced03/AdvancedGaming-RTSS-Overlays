# 🎮 **AdvancedGaming's RTSS Overlays** 🎮

Welcome to a collection of custom RivaTuner Statistics Server (RTSS) overlays that I've created!

## 🔧 **How to Use:**

1. Download the `.ovl` file of the overlay you want.
2. Paste the file into the following directory:  
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\RivaTuner Statistics Server\Plugins\Client\Overlays`.
   
> ⚠️ Depending on your system, you might need to make a few adjustments to ensure the names and stats reflect accurately.
